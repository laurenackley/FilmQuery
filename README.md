# FilmQuery

#Description
The official file name may be FilmQueryApp, but a better name may be... Blockbuster! This is a command-line application that retrieves and displays film data from a database. You can search for a film between 1-1000. If your search is out of bounds, you receive a message saying that there is no such film and to adjust your inquiry and puts you back to the main menu. If you search is within the bounds then you get the title, release year, rating, description, and what language it is in. It will also tell you the actor and actresses in the film.
The other option is that you can search for films by title of description using keywords.  For example, you can search by "Samurai" and you get the result:
"Title: SAMURAI LION, Release Year: 2010, Rated: G, Description: A Fast-Paced Story of a Pioneer And a Astronaut who must Reach a Boat in A Baloon, Language: Japanese
Actors and Actresses include:
[Angelina Astaire, Greg Chaplin]"
Which is one of my favorite movies. After the result, you get sent back to the main menu. Finally once you are finished searching by number or keyword, you can type in quit which will then end the program.

#Lessons Learned
This was definitely different than programs that we had done in the past. It was interesting to add SQL queries into java programs. Previously I was having a difficult time understanding when to throw exceptions and if it was helpful...but after this it made it a lot easier to understand that exceptions aren't exceptionally hard. It was a lot of fun to finally see all the pieces fitting together. I liked that I could run the program in Eclipse, then in Terminal to double check my work.
